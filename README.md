# Ramanujam's Algorithm 
This code implements the beautiful algorithm given by Ramanujam (in his paper 'Note on a set of simultaneous 
equations') to solve a specific set of nonlinear simultaneous polynomial (in vectors x and y) equations. 
Although there is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution, it is not appear to be 
checkable in polynomial time. Hence the code must be used with caution.
